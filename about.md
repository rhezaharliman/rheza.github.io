# Special Interest

* **Teaching and sharing** are one of my special interest. I did some voluntary activities like:
  * Volunteer as a presenter to explain the movie and do experiment with kids in Science Film Festival 2011.
  * I became a teaching assistant at several subjects when I was conducting my bachelor’s degree.
  * I was a tutor for one student to help her conduct the research in concentration recognition.
* I also keen in **Leadership and Organization**. I attend some leadership trainings either as trainer or trainee. 
* **Television program quality**. 
  I was working with a non-profit organization to make a mobile app to handle public’s report about the television programs that violate broadcast’s rule in Indonesia. The application was available at Play Store and I sometimes improve it on my leisure time. The appplication is turned down because the number of users is below expectations. By using this application, we was hoping that broadcasting quality in Indonesia improves because recently, most of the program is just about gossip and soap opera that has too many violence and bad mouths.
