This is my first time to create a blog.
I'm usually into mobile app development and machine learning (usually Java, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Python), and I think I should have time to check out some web development. That's why I start this blog. With this blog, I hope I can share some works that I am doing or learning.

See you on the next post!

Nb. This blog use Jekyll as the template.
